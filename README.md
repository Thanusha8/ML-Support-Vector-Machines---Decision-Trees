# ML-Support-Vector-Machines---Decision-Trees
Implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Decision Tree algorithms for classification and regression tasks.


## Overview

This repository contains implementations of two fundamental machine learning algorithms:

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** - For classification tasks with linear kernels
- **Decision Trees** - For both classification and regression problems

## Algorithms

### Support Vector Machines
